Create a function that accepts numbers as an attribute and can limit the number of records.

The functionality should accept a number and retrieve first n records (e.g., providing number `15` I should receive 15 first records from API).

use .net 6. first parametes is int, secont parameter is List<Countries>
Returns List<Countries>



To create a function that accepts a number as an attribute and returns the first 'n' records from a given list, you can follow the below steps.

Let's assume you have a `Country` class defined somewhere in your application:

```csharp
public class Country
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    // ... other properties if needed
}
```

Now, let's create the desired function:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class RecordLimiter
{
    public static List<Country> GetFirstNRecords(int n, List<Country> countries)
    {
        if(n < 0)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("The number of records to retrieve must be non-negative.");
        }

        return countries.Take(n).ToList();
    }
}
```

Here's how you can use this function:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        List<Country> countries = new List<Country>
        {
            new Country { Name = "USA" },
            new Country { Name = "Canada" },
            // ... Add more countries to your list as needed
        };

        int n = 15; // You want the first 15 countries
        var limitedCountries = RecordLimiter.GetFirstNRecords(n, countries);

        foreach (var country in limitedCountries)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(country.Name);
        }
    }
}
```

Note: This code uses the LINQ `Take` method to retrieve the first 'n' records from the list. If the list has less than 'n' records, it will just return the available records without any issues.
