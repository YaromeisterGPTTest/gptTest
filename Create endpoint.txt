I need an endpoint that can accept from 0 to 4 parameters. 1 and 3 parameters are string 2 and 4 parameters are int.
It should make a request to https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all to retrieve countries data.
It should pasre retrieved JSON to variable/object.

use .net 6 webAPI

To create an endpoint in a .NET 6 WebAPI project that can accept 0 to 4 parameters, where the 1st and 3rd parameters are strings and the 2nd and 4th parameters are ints, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New .NET 6 WebAPI Project:**
   If you haven't already, you can create a new project with:
   ```
   dotnet new webapi -n CountryAPI
   ```

2. **Install Necessary Packages:**
   You need to install the `Newtonsoft.Json` package to handle JSON:
   ```
   dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
   ```

3. **Update the Startup.cs:**
   Make sure you've added services for the necessary components. In the `ConfigureServices` method of `Startup.cs`, ensure you have:
   ```csharp
   services.AddControllers();
   ```

4. **Create the API Endpoint:**
   In your `Controllers` folder, create a new controller called `CountryController.cs` and add the following code:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class CountryController : ControllerBase
{
    private const string ApiUrl = "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all";

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetCountries(string param1 = null, int? param2 = null, string param3 = null, int? param4 = null)
    {
        using var httpClient = new HttpClient();
        var response = await httpClient.GetStringAsync(ApiUrl);
        var countries = JArray.Parse(response);

        // Do something with the parameters and countries data if needed

        return Ok(countries);
    }
}
```

This sets up a `GET` endpoint that can accept 0-4 parameters. The parameters are optional thanks to the default `null` values.

5. **Run Your API:**
   Navigate to the root directory of your project in your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

You can then access your API by navigating to `https://localhost:5001/api/country` in a web browser or a tool like Postman. You can provide parameters as query parameters in the URL, like this:
```
https://localhost:5001/api/country?param1=test&param2=123&param3=anotherTest&param4=456
```

Remember to handle errors and edge cases as necessary, and consider adding more detailed logic for processing or filtering the retrieved countries based on your application's needs.
